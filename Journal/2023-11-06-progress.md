## Created a Connection to GitHub

### Steps I Followed

1. Went to [AWS CodeSuite Settings Connections](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections).
2. Navigated to Settings > Connections and created a new connection.

## Purpose

I created this connection to GitHub in anticipation of automating deployments through GitHub Actions for future use cases. However, I am still working on the specifics of that aspect.

## Attempted to Create an IAM Role through OpenID Connect

I also tried to set up an IAM role through OpenID Connect. While I'm not entirely sure if this is the best method, I recognize that I need some sort of IAM setup to properly configure the GitHub Actions workflow.
