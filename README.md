# Board game sorting

I am currently working on a project to develop an Azure database that pulls data from the BoardGameGeek API and use that data to create an algorithm that sorts games based on how much a user would enjoy them. The algorithm will take into account factors such as game mechanics, play style, and user ratings to determine the most likely games that a user will enjoy playing.

This project is still in its early stages, but I am excited about the potential it has to help people discover new games that they love. By using machine learning algorithms to sort games, I hope to take some of the guesswork out of finding the perfect game and make it easier for people to enjoy their favorite hobby.

## Technologies to be used:

- Databricks
- Azure SQL
- Python
- Airflow

This technology stack will enable the development of the machine learning algorithm that will sort games based on their mechanics, play style, and user ratings. With this algorithm, users will be able to easily discover new games that they enjoy playing.

## Project Outline:

1. Pull data from BoardGameGeek API and clean using Python.
2. Upload cleaned data to Azure SQL.
3. Analyze data using queries to identify patterns in game mechanics, play style, and user ratings.
4. Develop machine learning algorithm to sort games based on identified patterns.
5. Test and refine algorithm to ensure accuracy.
6. Implement algorithm into Azure database to be used for sorting games.
7. Develop user interface for users to input preferences and receive game recommendations based on algorithmic sorting.
